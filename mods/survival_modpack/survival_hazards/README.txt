This mod adds a "Hazard Suit" to the game. The player is able to swim or
 otherwise enter "hazardous nodes" such as lava without being damaged, as long
 as the suit has energy left.

Currently, only swimming in lava is implemented. The mod exports a basic API
 to register new hazardous nodes from other mods. This mod also adds a test
 "Toxic Waste" liquid which is currently only obtainable via creative mode,
 or by using the /give and /giveme chat commands.

The hazard suit is based on the Lava Suit mod by yours truly, expanded to
 be able to cope with other hazardous materials.
